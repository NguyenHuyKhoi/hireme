MySQL 8.0 - Client does not support authentication protocol requested by server; consider upgrading MySQL client

- Downgrade "MySQL" to authenticate using good old "native_password"
- Replace "Node" package with MySQL Connecter X DevAPI

**Using the old mysql_native_password works:
- ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'YourRootPassword';
- FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
